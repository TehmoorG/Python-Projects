# Sudoku Solver using Backtracking

This repository contains a Sudoku solver implemented using the backtracking algorithm. It's a part of the larger "python projects" repository.

## Overview

The Sudoku solver is a simple yet efficient implementation that uses the backtracking algorithm to solve any valid Sudoku puzzle. Users can input their Sudoku board row by row, and the solver will attempt to find a solution and display the solved board.

## Features

- **User-friendly Input**: Users can easily input their Sudoku board row by row.
- **Efficient Algorithm**: Uses backtracking to efficiently solve the puzzle.
- **Formatted Display**: The solved board is displayed in a well-formatted manner for easy readability.

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the "python projects" repository.
2. Navigate to the Sudoku Solver directory.
3. Run the script using Python:

```bash
python sudoku_solver.py
```

1. Follow the on-screen prompts to input your Sudoku board.
2. View the solved board once the algorithm completes its execution.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Future Enhancements

- **Graphical User Interface**: A user-friendly GUI is in the works to allow users to input puzzles, view solutions, and interact with the solver in real-time.
